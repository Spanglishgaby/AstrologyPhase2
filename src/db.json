    "Today": "The transit of planets indicates that you should exercise caution when making financial decisions. Try to get professional advice. There may be opportunities to obtain financial assistance from in-laws. However, the transit of Rahu and Sun indicates that you would not make easy money and suffer financial loss due to a wrong decision. Many of you who are planning to enrol in research-related subjects would be successful due to the transit of Mercury and Venus. Students may achieve success if they take a foreign language course or learn new skills. Before making a presentation, professionals should work on their projects and do proper research and study. Short-distance travel is needed for your work, and a significant deal would be finalised this month. Because of the unfavourable planet passage, health should be prioritised. There is a good chance that you would not be able to get a good night's sleep."
